# Date Planner

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create an app that could make planning a date simple and effortless. Our app allows a user to easily find events happening in their city and identify restaurants located near the event venue. Based on event and restaurant selections the user can easily save an Itinerary that displays the plan for the date.

Through building this project, our team learned how to use Javascript to call APIs and display the data in an organized way on a webpage.
